        Recall that in the last lab, you illuminated the object pixel-by-pixel. This week, you'll flex your linear algebra skills and try something different. You will experiment with imaging methods that illuminate *multiple pixels* at a time. You'll find that if we design our masks in a clever way, our imaging system can be much more robust to noise than the single-pixel approach. You will generate a binary mask matrix that the projector will use to illuminate multi-pixel patterns onto your object. Before scanning your custom images, you'll walk through a basic multi-pixel imaging simulation to understand how it works, delve deeper into the differences between ideal and non-ideal imaging, and understand why certain matrices are better than others at imaging in noisy systems.

        *Note: A lot of the code to complete this lab will be provided for you to run. However, looking over the code to try to understand what it does is **highly encouraged**. Additionally, we will be writing **functions** to enable multiple parts of this lab to reuse the same code with minimal copy + pasting.*

        **Note: This lab will use 0-indexing, as Python uses 0-indexing.**

        Recall that we can define our imaging system by the following mathematical model:

        $$ H \vec{i} = \vec{s} $$ 

        $H$ is the imaging mask matrix, $\vec{i}$ is our image in column vector form, and $\vec{s}$ is the sensor output also in column vector form.

        In Imaging 2, we scanned our image by highlighting one pixel at a time in a mask. Each row $H_k$ of $H$ defined a 1-D representation of each mask. This meant that scanning an image with $n$ pixels would require an $H$ with $n$ rows. Since we project one mask at a time onto our image, we would need to do exactly $n$ scans. Take a $2\times2$ image for example: $H$ would need exactly 4 rows, and we would make 4 scans.

        Let's try something different. We'll still do $n$ scans of our image, but let's try to highlight more than one pixel per mask. We still want to be able to reconstruct our image from our sensor values. So the question is: how do you choose which pixels to illuminate with each mask?

        Begin by assigning each pixel value in the 2x2 image to a variable, $p_{ij}$, where $i$ is the row and $j$ is the column associated with the pixel location. <br/><br/>

        $$\begin{bmatrix} p_{00} & p_{01} \\ p_{10} & p_{11} \end{bmatrix}$$
        -->

        In our mathematical model above, we represent the 2x2 image as the 1D column vector: 

        $$\vec{i} = \begin{bmatrix} p_{00} \\ p_{01} \\ p_{10} \\ p_{11} \end{bmatrix}$$

        Likewise, the sensor reading column vector is represented as:

        $$\vec{s} = \begin{bmatrix} s_0 \\ s_1 \\ s_2 \\ s_3 \end{bmatrix}$$

        Where the sensor reading from the $k$th mask is $s_k$. In the example above, the sensor reading from the 2nd mask is $s_2$. (We consider $s_0$ to be the 0th mask.)

        To illustrate the relationship between the mask matrix $H$ (with per-row imaging masks $H_k$), the image vector $\vec{i}$, and the sensor reading vector $\vec{s}$, we provide you with this **Example System of Linear Equations:**

        $$
        \begin{align} 
        s_0 & = p_{00}\\
        s_1 & = p_{00} + p_{01}\\
        s_2 & = p_{00} + p_{10}\\
        s_3 & = p_{01} + p_{10} + p_{11}
        \end{align}
        $$

        **<span style = "color: red">*IMPORTANT*: The above system of equations is only an example! It only serves an illustrative purpose for this section of the lab. Please do not use it for the rest of the lab.</span>**

        How would you represent the above as a mask matrix $H$? Convince yourself that the image below does just that (where a **white pixel** represents a value of **1** and a **black pixel** represents a value of **0**).</font><br/><br/>

        <center>
            <b>Imaging Mask Matrix $H$ for the Example System of Linear Equations</b>
        <img src="public/mask_sample_4x4.png" align="center" style="height:200px" />
        </center>

        Recall that each row of our mask matrix represents a mask in 1-D form. We must *reshape* each row $H_k$ of $H$ into the 2-D mask (Mask $k$) itself before projecting it onto the image. To make sense of the $H$ matrix, it is helpful to look at each mask individually. Let's consider $H_0$, the 0th row of $H$. When we reshape the 1-D $1\times4$ row into a $2\times2$ mask, we get Mask 0 (below on the left). <br/><br/>

        <img src="public/H_4x4_split.png" align="center" style="height:200px" />
        </center>

        Now we can see that 

        $$H_k \vec{i} = s_k$$ 

        represents one of the equations in our system. 

        For example, the equation for $s_0$ only depends on one pixel, $p_{00}$, i.e. the top-left pixel of our $2\times2$ image. We can represent it algebraically as:

        $$s_0 = H_0 \vec{i}$$

        where $H_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

        So numerically, we can represent the equation as:

        $$s_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} p_{00} \\ p_{01} \\ p_{10} \\ p_{11} \end{bmatrix}$$

        Let's pause for a minute before we start capturing images with the projector. Recall from Imaging 2 that the projector setup is usually placed inside a cardboard box to prevent light from the outside world disturbing our sensor. Even when the projector is turned off, there might be a significant amount of light inside the box. The sensor and related circuits generate noise in our measurements due to thermal physics and other environmental factors. The refresh rate of the projector also contributes to noise. Thus, non-idealities like noise will inevitably be present in our setup. This is a limitation of the real-world setup that greatly affects our ability to reconstruct the image using the light sensor data. That's why it's important to build a simulator that **accurately models** what happens when we try to capture an image, including non-idealities that we can potentially compensate for.

        Our virtual simulated projector will artificially generate noise to affect sensor results in a way that mirrors this real-world phenomenon.

        ## <a id = 'idealSensor'><span style = "color: blue">Task 2a: Constructing an Ideal Sensor Model</span></a>

        Let's first construct a function that emulates what we would *hope* occurs when we scan an image (ideal imaging). An image (represented as the column vector $\vec{i}$) is placed in a region that can be illuminated by the projector. The projector projects a sequence of masks $H_k$ onto the image (illuminating certain pixels at a time). In our simulation, the digitized 'light sensor' output is the sum of the brightnesses detected across illuminated pixels. The $k^{th}$ entry of the sensor output vector, $s_k$, corresponds to the $k^{th}$ scan.

        Recall that these operations can be represented by the previously defined mathematical model:

        $$\vec{s} = H \vec{i}$$ 

        **<span style="color:red"> Your first goal is to translate this ideal model into a `simulate_ideal_capture` function (Fill in the TODO).

        The ideal reconstruction demonstrated above works great, right? Unfortunately, due to real-world non-idealities alluded to earlier, if you directly tried to image a drawing with the multipixel masks in $H$, the reconstruction would probably look terrible. A significant amount of engineering effort is focused on how to best translate theory into practice by attempting to compensate for or remove non-idealities. In the following sections, we'll look at some of the worst offenders and what we can do to improve reconstruction quality. 

        ### <a id = 'noiseSimulation'><span style = "color: blue">Noise *(Why So Grainy? â˜¹)*</span></a>

        We will see noise again later in Module 3,-- if you're really interested in modelling noise and its effects, it's covered more extensively upper division classes including EE123, EE126, EE142 -- but for now it's important to realize that both the light sensor circuit and the projector add noise that shows up in the digitized sensor output. Noise is what causes photos to look grainy or fuzzy. As an example, if your single pixel imaging system from last week happened to be very noisy (and usually, the cheaper the system, the noisier it is...), imaging the playing card from before might've produced something like: <br/><br/>

        <center>
        <img src="public/noisy_card.png" align="center" style="height:200px" />
        </center>

        The noisier your system, the less the resultant image will look like what you expected â˜¹.

        One way to make noise less problematic is to increase the number of pixels illuminated per scan. This increases the "signal level" (i.e. contributions from things we actually care about). At the same time, the amount of noise coming from the light sensor circuit and projector should stay mostly constant, thus improving the so-called *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR) of our system. This is important to know when choosing `avg_1s_per_row` for our random binary mask.

        However, in reality, the number of pixels illuminated per scan is limited by the ambient light sensor circuit. This is because at high brightness levels, the sensor circuit becomes saturated. The difference in sensor reading for each additional illuminated pixel becomes quite small, and thus we lost the ability to differentiate the number of illuminated pixels.

        Another way to make noise less problematic is to repeat each scan $k$ (with the same illumination pattern) many times and *average* the sensor outputs. The desired signal is always present, but the *random* error (noise) changes on each repeat scan. Thus, you can "average out the noise" at the expense of spending more time acquiring the image. This is actually what the Arduino code used in lab does under the hood.

        Generally speaking, we would like to build a sensing system that is as noise robust as possible, but what does that entail?

        When noise is included, the mathematical model of our imaging system would look like:

        $$ \vec{s} = H \vec{i} + \vec{\omega} +\vec{o} $$

        The vector $\vec{o}$ is a vector of equal entries, which represents a constant offset from extra light from the projector while it is projecting the color black. Even though black is supposed to be an absence of light, there is still a glow present from the projector that can offset our measurement by a scalar amount. This needs to be removed, but can easily be done so by measuring and subtracting it. 

        The elements ($\omega_k$) of the column vector $\vec{\omega}$ correspond to the random amounts of noise added at each measurement $s_k$. We cannot remove noise, but we can try to reduce its effects.

        For example, you might expect your sensor readings $\vec{s}$ to be something like 

        \begin{equation}
        \vec{s_{expected}} = \begin{bmatrix}
        51 \\
        65 \\
        42 \\
        \vdots \\
        32
        \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}

        But you may get something like

        \begin{equation}
        \vec{s_{reality}} = \begin{bmatrix}
        61.2 \\
        76.0 \\
        51.7 \\
        \vdots \\
        44.0
        \end{bmatrix}\;.
        \end{equation}

        This means that what you are getting is really

        \begin{equation}
            \vec{s_{reality}} = \vec{s_{expected}} \;+\; \vec{\omega} \;+\; \vec{o}
        \end{equation}

        \begin{equation}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                61.2 \\
                76.0 \\

                \vdots \\
                44.0
            \end{bmatrix} = 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                51 \\
                65 \\
                42 \\
                \vdots \\
                32
            \end{bmatrix}
            \;+\;
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0.2 \\
                1.0 \\
                -0.3 \\
                \vdots \\
                2.0
                \end{bmatrix}
            \;+\;
            \begin{bmatrix}
                10 \\
                10 \\
                10 \\
                \vdots \\
                10
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}

        where the last two vectors are $\vec{\omega}$ and $\vec{o}$

        As you can see, once you measure the offset, it is very easy to just subtract from your measurements. We will take care of this for you in the experimental portion of the lab (below), so you don't need to worry about it. We will ignore it in the rest of the notebook, and assume it is subtracted.

        From this point forward, our key equation will look like this:

        $$ \vec{s} = H \vec{i} + \vec{\omega}$$

        Now we will try to reconstruct the image $\vec{i}$ with matrix inversion $H^{-1}$:

        $$ H^{-1}\vec{s} = H^{-1}H \vec{i} + H^{-1}\vec{\omega}$$

        $$ H^{-1}\vec{s} = \vec{i} + H^{-1}\vec{\omega}$$

        We will call $H^{-1}\vec{s} = \vec{i_{est}}$ leaving us with 
        $$\vec{i_{est}} = H^{-1} \vec{s} = \vec{i} + H^{-1} \vec{\omega}$$

        Remember that we were hoping to solve for just $\vec{i}$. The additional undesired term $H^{-1} \vec{\omega}$ is what we call our reconstruction *error*, which results from linearly transforming the original noise vector $\vec{\omega}$ by $H^{-1}$. This implies that our choice of $H$ (and therefore $H^{-1}$) strongly influences how robust our overall imaging system is.

        Multiplying both sides of this equation by $A^{-1}$ and dividing by $\lambda_i$ allows us to rewrite this equation as:

        $$A^{-1} \vec{v_{\lambda_i}} = \frac{1}{\lambda_i} \vec{v_{\lambda_i}} $$ 

        How does this help reconstruct our image? We know that $H$, which is an $N \times N$ matrix, is invertible, and thus we know it has at most $N$ linearly independent eigenvectors. 

        Our matrix $H$ also has another property, which we haven't learned about yet: it is **diagonalizable**. Diagonalizable matrices are beyond the scope of this course (but covered in EECS16B). For now, all you need to know is that a diagonalizable $N \times N$ matrix $H$ has *precisely* N linearly-independent eigenvectors.

        So if we know $H$ has N eigenvectors, we know they span $\mathbb{R}^N$. In other words, the eigenvectors of $H$ form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^N$. Well, guess what? Our noise vector lies in $\mathbb{R}^N$. So we can write it as a linear combination of the eigenvectors like so:

        $$\vec{\omega} = \alpha_1 \vec{v_1} + ... + \alpha_N \vec{v_N}$$

        Now if we apply $H^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation,

        $$H^{-1} \vec{\omega} = H^{-1} \alpha_1 \vec{v_1} + ... + H^{-1}\alpha_N \vec{v_N}$$

        Pull out the $\alpha$ constants in front of $H^{-1}$ since scalars commute with matrices

        $$H^{-1} \vec{\omega} = \alpha_1 H^{-1} \vec{v_1} + ... + \alpha_N H^{-1} \vec{v_N}$$

        And we can apply the eigenvector identity shown above:

        $$H^{-1} \vec{\omega} = \alpha_1 \frac{1}{\lambda_1} \vec{v_1} + ... + \alpha_N \frac{1}{\lambda_N} \vec{v_N}$$

        So we can see that regardless of the scaling constants $\alpha$, if we have very large eigenvalues of $H$ then each component of $\vec{\omega}$ is attenuated, and likewise if each eigenvalue is small, the noise vector will be amplified.

After applying two different matrices, $H_1^{-1}$ and $H_2^{-1},$ we can see how each vector is transformed. Ideally we would want the $\vec{\omega}$ vector to be $\vec{0}$, so the recovered image is the same as the ideal reconstruction. Adding everything together to get the final result, we have $\vec{i}+H^{-1}\vec{\omega}$. Depending on the choice of $H$, the noise may end up amplified or attenuated.
