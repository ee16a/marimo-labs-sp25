    "GPS satellites broadcast a variety of measurements such as the satellite's position and velocity, as well as time, using a very precise clock. GPS receivers make use of the fact that light propagates at a known speed: $3\\times 10^8 ms^{-1}$. A receiver can therefore compute its distance to the satellite by measuring how long it takes the GPS signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver, using the speed of light and the known time that the signal was broadcasted from the satellite.\n",

    "Our APS setup will use multiple speakers as 'beacons' to emit signals, and a single microphone receiver. The receiver will receive the sum of all the emitted signals at various delays, depending on the relative distances between the speakers and microphone. To identify each speaker's emitted signal from the received signal, as well as the time delay associated with each component, we will use **cross-correlation** analysis. In particular, the combined received signal will be cross correlated with stored copies of **each** speaker's unique emitted signal.\n",

    "**[Cross-correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)** is a measure of similarity between two functions - in this case these 'functions' will be vectorized time domain signals. It is a mathematical operation defined by taking successive inner products as one vector 'slides past the other', roughly speaking. Intuitively this is a measure of the 'overlap' between two signals as one signal is shifted in time. For discrete signals, the 'overlap' at time $t$ of the received signal and a copy of a particular speaker generated signal is the inner product of the received signal at that time and a shifted version of the stored copy. Both a mathematical definition and an animation are shown below where $x$ and $y$ are real valued functions.\n",

However, as the receiver is not synchronized with the rest of the beacons, we do not know when in the loop we started recording the beacon signals on the receiver. If we record for exactly the number of samples in one period of a beacon signal, we most likely started recording after some portion of the beacon signal has already been transmitted.\n",
