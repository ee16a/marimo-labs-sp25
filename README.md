# marimo-labs-sp25
This repository holds the Marimo versions of EECS16A Jupyter Notebook labs.

Installation guide: https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/

Documentation: https://docs.marimo.io/api/

Each of the current EECS16A labs have a .py file that represents the Marimo notebook version. To run the notebook, use `marimo edit` within the folder (similar to `jupyter notebook`).

These labs are similar to their Jupyter counterparts, but utilize Marimo specific UI components for hints, text answers, sliders, buttons, etc. These UI components and graphs can be simply embedded into markdown cells to create interactive and interesting demos. Noteably, Shazam, APS, and VR1 have these demos, with plans to integrate into more labs.
